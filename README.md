# 🚀 FastAPI Docker Deployment with GitHub Actions

Welcome to the **FastAPI Docker Deployment** project! This repository demonstrates how to automate the creation and deployment of a Dockerized FastAPI application using **GitHub Actions**. Whether you're a DevOps enthusiast or a developer looking to streamline your CI/CD pipeline, this project is for you!

---

## 🌟 Features

- **FastAPI Server**: A lightweight Python web server that responds with JSON data.
- **Dockerized Application**: Containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.
- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Automates the build and push process to Docker Hub on every `push` event.

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) account
- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/simrannegi/devops-assignment-2.git
cd devops-assignment-2
```

### 2. Run the FastAPI Server Locally
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
3. Access the server at: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

---

## 🐳 Docker Setup

### 1. Build the Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t simrannegi/fastapi-app:latest .
```

### 2. Run the Docker Container
```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 simrannegi/fastapi-app:latest
```

### 3. Access the FastAPI Server
Open your browser and go to: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## 🤖 GitHub Actions Workflow

This project uses GitHub Actions to automate the build and deployment process. Here's how it works:

1. **Trigger**: The workflow runs on every `push` event.
2. **Steps**:
   - Check out the repository.
   - Log in to Docker Hub using a secret token.
   - Build the Docker image.
   - Push the image to Docker Hub.

### View the Workflow
Check out the workflow file: [.github/workflows/DockerBuild.yml](.github/workflows/DockerBuild.yml)

## 🔐 Docker Hub Token Setup

To push the Docker image to Docker Hub, you need to set up a **Personal Access Token**:

1. Go to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) → **Account Settings** → **Security** → **Access Tokens**.
2. Generate a new token and copy it.
3. Add the token as a secret in your GitHub repository:
   - Go to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**.
   - Add a new secret named `DOCKERTOKEN` and paste the token value.
